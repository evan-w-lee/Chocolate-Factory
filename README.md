_New updates every week!_

## Versions

### ALPHA patch v0.7.1
**NOTES:**
oops.

**FEATURES:**
N/A

**BUGS:**
* Fixed fatal error where the boxes display was always visible
* Fixed more font issues


### ALPHA v0.7.0
**NOTES:**
Believe it or not, this was one of the most boring coding sessions of my life. Also, I know I said that next was making a better tutorial, but next is probably not that because I'm too lazy. I did add support for different types of chocolate. It took forever because of all the things that I didn't think of when I first made all of the game's systems. I probably should've used OOP.

**FEATURES:**
* Added the Boxes project, which makes a better reputation for more money spent
* Added a visual for reputation
* Changed debug key to {I} so *some hackers* will be confused
* Added support for other chocolates (XTRACHOCOLATE in the code)

**BUGS:**
* Fixed font issues
* Made it so info bubbles don't appear when you've already looked at them
* Fixed fatal issue with the seller changing feature


>### ALPHA v0.6.0
>**NOTES:**
>Worker pay was really, really messed up. I'm sorry, it was a nightmare to debug. You know what I had to do to make the workers pay increase correctly? Instead of doing the
>simple thing (worker pay + 0.1), I had to this: (worker pay - -0.1). Yep, subtracting by a negative number.
>
>Also, I was dumb and updated my computer with the update log not saved, so I was in the middle of making this update and I had no idea what I changed cause I lost all the >info. I had to compare v0.5.6 to the code saved on my hard drive. If only I was smarter. :/
